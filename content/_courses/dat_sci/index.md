### Overview
<details class="description" close><summary data-close="Show" data-open="Hide"></summary>
Data Science is the science of extracting knowledge and information from data and requires competencies in both statistical and computer-based data analysis. This module is part of our complementary studies which are supposed to familiarize students with the entrepreneurial challenges of the future and expand their knowledge on important aspects of technology management.
<br><br>
In this module, students learn how to acquire, cleanse, and transform large amounts of data online using various techniques. The aim is to explore, visualize, and model the related data in a target-oriented way, using modern methods of machine learning. This is a class for programming with R. It is designed for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language, with hands-on examples. Throughout the class, you will use your newfound skills to solve practical data science problems.
<br><br>

<b>Course structure</b>
<br>
Over the course of seven days, each with two sessions, students will create a coding portfolio demonstrating a variety of data-analysis and communication skills. Each session will involve a small amount of lecturing on R concepts, and a large amount of time for students to complete coding and analysis problems assigned on a daily basis.
