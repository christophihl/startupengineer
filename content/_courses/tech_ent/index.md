### Overview
<details class="description" close><summary data-close="Show" data-open="Hide"></summary>
Startups are temporary, team-based organizations, which can form independently, but also within established companies. They pursue one central objective: taking a business idea to market by finding and designing a repeatable and scalable business model. This entrepreneurial process involves gathering and combining resources that you do not (yet) possess and dealing with high uncertainty about what combinations of resources actually generate value. This course module is designed to introduce students to a systematic Startup Engineering approach to master the process of taking a business idea to market in light of resource contraints and uncertainty.
<br><br>
Startup Engineering takes an iterative approach, in that it favors variety and alternatives over one detailed, linear five-year business plan to reach steady state operations. From a problem solving and systems thinking perspective, Startup Engineers create different possible versions of a new venture and alternative hypotheses about value creation for customers and value capture vis-à-vis competitors. To test critical hypotheses early on, Startup Engineers engage in an evidence-based, experimental trial-and-error learning process that measures real progress.
<br><br>
The workflow in this course module is comprised of three elements:

1. {{< hl >}}(Flipped) classroom{{< /hl >}}: learning about and discussing concepts and tools currently prevailing in theory and practice of modern technology entrepreneurship.
2. {{< hl >}}Problem-based learning{{< /hl >}}: deepen an understanding of the concepts and tools by seeing them applied and applying them to real company cases.
3. {{< hl >}}Experiential learning{{< /hl >}}: applying the concepts and tools in teams to an own new startup project.

Students are invited to apply to this course module already with a startup idea and/ or team, but this is not a requirement. We will form teams and ideas in the beginning of the course.

### Grading

* `50%` (team): Development and pitch of an own startup project - This is a combination of your intermediate and final pitches. We especially look at the usage of frameworks presented in the course materials as well as form and presentation style.
* `30%` (team): Three case solutions (one from each of the three parts of the course) - The focus will be on evaluating the clarity and coherence of the reasoning process that led to the conclusion. Each group must thoroughly detail the steps and logic they employed to ensure their analytical approach is both transparent and replicable.
* `20%` (individual): Class participation - Ensuring that each group member is actively contributing towards lecture and exercise sessions and presents a part of each pitch.
