### Abstract

**AI-InnoScEnCE** (*AI-Empowered Innovation in Natural Science and Engineering for the Circular Economy*) is a multi-institutional European project funded under the **EIT Higher Education Initiative (HEI)**. The project aims to strengthen innovation ecosystems and empower higher education institutions to become central drivers of sustainable, AI-enabled value creation.

Running from **2025 to 2027**, the project brings together universities, research centers, and industry partners across Europe to enhance institutional innovation capacity, improve entrepreneurship education, and accelerate the transition toward a **circular economy**. At the core of AI-InnoScEnCE lies the integration of advanced artificial intelligence methods into innovation processes, matchmaking activities, and collaboration interfaces between academia, industry, and start-ups.

### Project Goals

AI-InnoScEnCE addresses four interconnected challenges in the transformation of the European innovation landscape:

1. **Strengthening Innovation Capacity**  
   The project supports higher education institutions in developing robust innovation support structures and cross-institutional cooperation formats. These include new service units, innovation management processes, and digital interfaces for knowledge transfer and co-creation.

2. **Empowering Talent for the Circular Economy**  
   AI-InnoScEnCE designs and delivers training programs for students, researchers, academic staff, and industry professionals. The programs integrate cutting-edge AI tools, promoting skills in data-driven decision-making, sustainable innovation design, and entrepreneurial problem-solving.

3. **Enhancing Science–Enterprise Collaboration**  
   By introducing AI-based methods for opportunity mapping, stakeholder analysis, and collaboration matchmaking, the project improves the efficiency and quality of partnerships between academia and industry. These activities aim to create new innovation pathways, accelerate commercialization, and strengthen regional and European innovation ecosystems.

4. **Supporting Start-ups and SMEs**  
   Through tailored mentoring, training programs, and access to AI-driven analytical tools, the project assists early-stage ventures in identifying circular economy opportunities, developing sustainable business models, and scaling innovation activities.

### Contribution to Research and Practice

From a research perspective, AI-InnoScEnCE provides valuable insights into:

- the integration of **AI in innovation management and technology scouting**,  
- data-driven opportunity recognition in circular value chains,  
- evidence-based support for entrepreneurial development,  
- and institutional change processes within higher education.

The project also develops practical tools and frameworks for HEIs, including:

- AI-assisted collaboration platforms,  
- training and mentoring toolkits,  
- innovation capacity self-assessment instruments,  
- and best-practice guidelines for sustainable and circular innovation.

### Broader Impact

AI-InnoScEnCE aims to create long-term, systemic impact by enabling universities to adopt **AI-powered innovation practices** and by reinforcing their role as catalysts of change in European regions. Through science–industry synergies and a strong focus on circularity, the project contributes directly to the objectives of the European Green Deal and the twin transition toward a **digital and sustainable economy**.
