## Course organization

All participants are supposed to form teams of 5 students. These teams should primarily form around a common startup project idea. How to go about finding an idea will be subject of the first session described under [**Inroduction**]({{< relref "_syllabi/tech_ent/1_intro.md" >}}).

The weekly class sessions follow along a process to develop your startup projects. Teams will be provided with materials for each topic and step in the process before each class session. Students are supposed to read and watch the material before class. In the first part of each class session, we will discuss the tools and concepts and how they might apply to your specific projects ideas. Your task is to continously elaborate and improve your startup projects based on the tools, concepts and feedback received. Teams get the chance to receive comprehensive feedback based on a recorded intermediate pitches of their projects in the beginning of June. The final pitch of your startup projects is due by the end of class in July.

In the second half of each class session, we will discuss a case study related to the respective topic. Students are supposed to have read (not solved) each case before class. We will briefly clarify questions about the case, then students will work in breakout sessions on an intial solution of the case (for approximately an hour) within their teams. These initial solutions are then uploaded to Studip and (selectively) discussed among all partcipants. Teams then get the chance to rework their case solutions after class for their final case subission (prior to the following week's class). 

The case study work only applies to students that are enrolled either in the entire module worth 6 ECTS or in both "Betrieb & Management" courses "Technology Entrepreneurship" and "Creation of Business Opportunities". For students enrolled in the entire module worth 6 ECTS, we pay close attention to your contributions to class and case discussions. In addition, we expect case memos about three self-selected cases to be submitted before class. A case memo is about three typed pages long (1-inch margins, 12 pt font size and 1.5 line spacing) and should cover brief reflections on the assignment questions for each case (not complete answers, analyses or solutions).
