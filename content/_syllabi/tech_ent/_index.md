## Course organization

<details class="description" close><summary data-close="Show" data-open="Hide"></summary>

All participants are supposed to form teams of 5 students. These teams should primarily form around a common startup project idea. How to go about finding an idea and a team will be subject of the first session described under [**Inroduction**]({{< relref "_syllabi/tech_ent/1_intro.md" >}}).

The weekly class sessions follow along a process to develop your startup projects. Teams will be provided with materials for each topic and step in the process before each class session. Students are supposed to read and watch the material before each class. In the first part of each class session, we will discuss the tools and concepts and how they might apply to your specific projects ideas. Your task is to continously elaborate and improve their startup projects based on the learned tools and concepts and the feedback received. Teams get the chance to receive comprehensive feedback based on a recorded intermediate pitch of their projects in the beginning of June. The final pitch version of your startup projects is due by the end of class in July.

In the second half of each class sessions, we will discuss a case study related to each respective topic. Students are supposed to have read (not solved) each case before class. We will briefly clarify questions about the case, then students will work in breakout sessions on an intial solutions of the case (for approximately an hour) within their same teams. These initial solutions are then uploaded to Studip and (selectively) discussed among all partcipants. Teams then get the chance to rework their case solutions after class for their final case subissions (prior to the following week's class). 

The case study work only applies to students that are enrolled either in the entire module worth 6 ECTS or in both "Betrieb & Management" courses "Technology Entrepreneurship" and "Creation of Business Opportunities". 

For students enrolled in the entire module worth 6 ECTS, we pay close attention to their contributions to class and case discussions. In addition, we expect case memos about three self-selected cases to be submitted before the respective class session. A case memo is about three typed pages long (1-inch margins, 12 pt font size and 1.5 line spacing) and should cover the following aspects of a case: 
* `One-paragraph (executive) summary`: what is the context, key issue(s) & decision points, and your recommendation?
* `Background & context`: how did the current situation come about? What factors need to be conisdered to derive recommendations?
* `Recommendations`: what are the alternatives? How would you prioritize? Why?
* `Next steps`: How should your recommendations be implemented?
