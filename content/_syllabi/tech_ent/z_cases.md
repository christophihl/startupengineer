## Note

If you want to submit a case memo or solution, please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in the folder named after the session that the case belongs to`. Please use the following file name and info:
* **individal case memo**: `lastname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `ihl_zenatix.pdf`. The file itself must contain your full name and immatriculation number.
* **team case memo**: `teamname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `memetrify_zenatix.pdf`. The team name can be anything as long as it remains unique and invariant throughout the course (exceptions allowed in case of team reformations). The file itself must contain *all* your full names and immatriculation numbers.

## Revenue Models and Pricing

**Case 1**: [PassionConnect](https://www.dropbox.com/s/39fbzukq6hvj4vj/PassionConnect.pdf?dl=0) (use this case for individual memos, or just read it to prepare in-class group work)

`Assigments Questions`:
1) What criteria should the co-founders use to evaluate each of the revenue models they consider? [^1]
[^1]: Here is a list of possible criteria:
	- **Financial:** predictability of revenues (recurring vs. one-time); positive cash flow cycle (earn before you spend); profit potential; fixed vs. variable cost; customer acquisition / marketing cost
	- **Users / customers:** impact on user experience; impact on user growth (speed up or slow down); scalability with new users; conversion rate (to paying users)
	- **Feasibility:** alignment with founder goals and value proposition; required investment to launch, integration / fit with current business activities
2) Can you come up with an additonal revenue model they do not yet consider?
3) Evaluate each revenue model against your selection of criteria – which one should they choose?
4) What are the key decisions to be made for the chosen revenue model in order to implement it?

<br/>

**Case 2**: [MoviePass](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wmduhuj1x9bfx5z/MoviePass.pdf?dl=0) (do not use this case for individual memos, just read it to prepare in-class group work)

2) Are movie goers beeing subsidized? Calculate the average gross margin per user (AGMPU)!

`Assigments Questions`:
1) What is Eventbrite's TAM, SAM, SOM? Compare and/ or combine top down and bottom up approaches.
2) How would you describe Eventbrite's competition? Whom does Eventbrite compare to and compete with?

## Lean Startup & Experimentation

`Please choose in advance one of the following three cases to work on in your group. Then it would only be smart to choose this case also for an optional individual case memo :wink:`

**Case 1**: [Rent The Runway](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cbwkgjhav6p3xam/RentTheRunway.pdf?dl=0)

**Case 2**: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vna6mxwy68pov2o/Dropbox.pdf?dl=0)

3) How do you evaluate these validation efforts? What was good, what could be improved and how?
4) What hypotheses should the company validate next? And how?
