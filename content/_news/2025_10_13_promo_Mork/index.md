In his dissertation *“Causal Analyses on Entrepreneurial Intention, Success, and Failure”*, **Oliver Mork** explores the entrepreneurial process across its entire life cycle — from the formation of entrepreneurial intentions to the aftermath of venture failure and potential re-entry. The dissertation follows two intertwined paths: a topical journey through the stages of entrepreneurship and a methodological journey leveraging modern causal inference techniques to uncover reliable cause-and-effect relationships.  

Across three empirical studies, Oliver investigates key stages of entrepreneurship:  
- **Pre-Venture Stage:** A randomized controlled experiment reveals how autonomous team formation enhances entrepreneurial intention, while self-efficacy depends on peer interaction under conditions of autonomy.  
- **Venture and Growth Stage:** Using natural experiments based on exogenous travel shocks, the study identifies causal effects of venture capitalists’ on-site monitoring, demonstrating the importance of physical proximity for innovation, survival, and successful exits.  
- **Post-Venture Stage:** Combining quasi-experimental methods with natural language processing of large-scale news data, the study shows that negative media narratives amplify stigma and deter re-entry, whereas balanced reporting supports renewed entrepreneurial activity.  

By integrating **rigorous causal identification strategies**—including randomized trials, natural experiments, and quasi-experimental designs—the dissertation not only enhances our understanding of the entrepreneurial process but also sets a methodological benchmark for future research in entrepreneurship.
