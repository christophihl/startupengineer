ICOs represent a new type of financing method that enables start-ups to collect capital from a large number of mainly small investors. Carolin Brückmann addresses to ICO investors to show how investors navigate this new kind of investment environment. The composition and interaction of various investor groups was investigated along three studies. Furthermore, she analysed to what extent investors are able to select successful start-ups in a targeted manner.
