This years’ research colloquium on “Innovation and Value Creation” took place in Hamburg. Around 60 to 80 scholars from various research backgrounds, such as innovation management, entrepreneurship, organization and workplace design, information systems, and public policy met, in order to exchange recent research findings and future research plans. 

The kick-off event started in the very traditional “Hotel Hafen Hamburg”. Every member of this reseach group was welcomed by Profs. Ralf Reichwald and Christoph Ihl. Our guests were hosted in a very Hanseatic atmosphere with excellent view on “St. Pauli Landungsbrücken”. This was a wonderful evening together with many members of the so-called “Reichwald-Family” from renowned universities such as TUM, RWTH, UE, TUC, JKU, UM, HHL, HSU, FAU, UH, FHS and TUHH.

Next morning, the conference started at the InnovationCampus Green Technologies (ICGT) located in the small harbor of Harburg. Prof. Dr. Andreas Timm-Giel, Vice-President of TUHH welcomed the participants and was followed by Dr. Carsten Brosda, Hamburg Senator for Culture and Media. His lecture was titled: „Wie entwickelt sich die Handelsstadt Hamburg zur digitalen Stadt mit Zukunft?“ (How will Hamburg develop from a trade city to a digital city in future?). Then, an equally interesting speech was held by Prof. Linus Dalander from ESMT, Berlin.

Our scholars were divided into three different slots to get the opportunity of presenting their newest research project in order to get feedback from experienced researchers and to exchange on that field of work. This platform was a great opportunity for young researchers emerging from special institutes to develop their research within a trusted community. 

The ultimate session took place at the “Empire Riverside Hotel” on Saturday morning. Our Ph.Ds got input for their future research work and were glad about having met other researchers working on similar fields of study.
