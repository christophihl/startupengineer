In September 2017 Christoph Ihl and Hannes Lampe joined the TIE-Conference in Koblenz-Landau. Many researchers had been invited by Profs. Harald von Korflesch, Mario Schaarschmidt and Frank Piller. This was a great opportunity to exchange and discuss about topics on start-up funding, innovation-management as well as on open innovation. 
The second day of the conference took place at WHU, Otto-Beisheim-School of Management.
