The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org) has published a managerial summary of our latest research on team autonomy, which can be found [here](https://hbr.org/2021/12/when-autonomy-helps-team-performance-and-when-it-doesnt).

It is based on our research paper "Organizing Entrepreneurial Teams: A Field Experiment on Autonomy over Choosing Teams and Ideas" which is published in [Organization Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/orsc.2021.1520).
