The topic of the 2015 conference invited members to consider opportunities to improve the effectiveness and creativity of organizations 
by restructuring systems at the highest organizational levels. The term 'governance' refers to leadership systems, managerial control protocols, 
property rights, decision rights, and other practices that give organizations their authority and mandates for action.

Christoph Ihl, Hannes Lampe and Jan Reerink participated in this conference.
