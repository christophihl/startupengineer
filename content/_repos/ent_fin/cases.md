## Note

In the second part of each class session, we will discuss a real company case study related to the respective lecture topics. Students are supposed to have read (not solved) each case before class. We will briefly clarify questions about the case, then students will work in breakout sessions on an intial solution of the case (for approximately 1.5 hours) within teams of up to 5 students. These initial solutions are then (selectively) discussed among all partcipants. Based on the team solutions and joint discussions, students should then write up individual case solutions to be uploaded to Studip prior to the following week's class.

If you want to submit a case solution, please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in the folder named after your lastname`. Please use the following file name and info:
`lastname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `ihl_microsoft.pdf`. The file itself must contain your full name and immatriculation number as well as your team members names you discussed the case with.

## 1) Introduction: Evaluating Venture Opportunities

**Case**: [Hardina Smythe and the Healthcare Investment Conundrum (HBS-9-881-073)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9hg1gy8ht0pf3op/HardinaSmythe.pdf?dl=0)

`Abstract`:
Hardina Smythe, a recent MBA graduate, has just joined a top-tier venture capital firm in the difficult environment of late 2010. Her first assignment is to evaluate three different deals and make recommendations to the partners. Each potential investment has strengths and drawbacks for both the firm and Hardina.

`Assignment Questions`:
1) How should Vine Brook evaluate each of these potential investments?
2) How can Hardina best position Vine Brook and herself for success? Put yourself in Hardina Smythe's place and make a PowerPoint presentation that evaluates the three options and recommends one for further due diligence?

## 2) Financial Planning

**Case**: [GenapSys: Business Models for the Genome (HBS-5-816-035)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/83nybff6ecyqr0e/CampusHash.pdf?dl=0), [supplemental Excel worksheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2g7zxpfhit19ep/eSig.xlsx?dl=0)

`Abstract`:
GenapSys, a California-based startup, was soon to release a new DNA sequencer that the company's founder, Hesaam Esfandyarpour, believed was truly revolutionary. The sequencer would be substantially less expensive-potentially costing just a few thousand dollars-and smaller than other sequencers, many of which were large devices costing tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars. GenapSys' device, named GENIUS, could also quickly generate large amounts of data, as it was capable of sequencing an entire human genome in less than eight hours. At this price, GenapSys' device would be attractive to customers that had been unable to afford sequencers, such as smaller laboratories or hospitals, and even expand the market to include industries such as agriculture and biofuels. As GenapSys came closer to releasing its product, Esfandyarpour and his Senior Director of Operations and Strategy, Leila Rastegar (HBS '11), sat down to decide which of three business models they would choose to bring this device to market. In the first model, the company would sell sequencers at a higher price to those entities which already purchased sequencers, primarily major research labs and pharmaceutical firms, but position its machine as a faster alternative to existing technologies. In the second model, GenapSys would sell its sequencer at a lower price but charge more for the cartridges necessary to run a sample, and earn its primary revenue from these cartridges. The third model would see GenapSys sell its device at or around cost, but use the data customers generated to create a proprietary database of genetic information. Customers could pay to access the database for research, to create genetic tests, or for many other purposes. GenapSys would also build an online store with the genetic tests customers created. Esfandyarpour's and Rastegar's decision would determine GenapSys' customer base and financial position for the coming years, and also impact development and capital needs of the firm. Which was the right model to bring the device to market and have a meaningful impact?

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What do we know about the market for gene sequences? How do you expect the market to develop? What are the major uncertainties that must be taken into consideration?
2) Evaluate the three strategic options Esfandyarpour and Rastegar are considering. What has to be true about the market, competitors and the companyâ€™s operating performance for each to be successful? What are the major risks for each? What has to go right for each of the strategies to work? What could go wrong and what are the consequences?
3) Using the associated exercise, calculate the cumulative cash flow curves for each strategy using the assumptions in the exercise. Which strategy maximizes the value realized by the founders? Assess the additional implications of each of the cash flow curves. After analyzing the given cash flow curves, change the assumptions in the model to see if you can come up with a strategy that better harmonizes the goals of the founders with the likely expectations of investors. How would you describe your choice of strategy to your current and potential investors? 
4) If given the opportunity to invest in any of the three strategies on attractive terms, which would you choose and why? What risks are you most concerned about?

## 3) Ownership and Returns

**Case**: [Crafting a Founder Agreement at HealthCraft (HBS-9-813-101)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p7317ce986oxa9j/HealthCraft.pdf?dl=0)

`Abstract`:
HealthCraft's three founders are about to craft their founding agreement and split the equity among themselves. Uncertainty lingers over each member's future contributions, though-how is the team to devise a durable and effective split? Ever since consultant Kevin Rumsfeld conceived of the idea for HealthCraft, he had worked resolutely to begin building the company by recruiting a talented colleague to help with marketing and fundraising, and a junior member of one of his project teams to help him build the product. All three had been enthusiastically working on HealthCraft part-time for the last few months, contributing from personal savings to build a prototype. But now the pressure is on to discuss and finalize a founding agreement. 

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What should the founders include in their agreement?
2) How should the founders structure their equity split?

## 4) Valuation Methods

**Case**: [Outreach Networks: First Venture Round" (UV-6569)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3tbxexkmlzv1pz1/Outreach.pdf?dl=0), [supplemental Excel worksheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x7sznc9o35exvm4/Outreach.xlsx?dl=0)

`Abstract`:
OutReach Networks is an unusual start-up company in that it was profitable early in its development and did not have to seek VC funding to support its growth. The company has grown quickly and may soon be a candidate for an IPO. In November 2011, an experienced venture capitalist approaches the founder with an offer to invest $30 million in exchange for 30% of the company. While the founder sees some benefit from the VC's experience in preparing the firm for an IPO and the funding enabling it to scale more quickly, he cannot understand how the VC has arrived at this offer.

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What are the challenges of valuing an early stage company?
2) In what way is ORN a typical startup company?
3) What is the value of the firm under the venture capital method?
4) What is the value of the firm under the discounted cash-flow method?
5) Is Everest Partners justified in asking for a 30% equity stake?
