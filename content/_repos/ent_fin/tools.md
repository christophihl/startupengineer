## 1) Introduction: Evaluating Venture Opportunities


[`Venture Evaluation Matrix`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0q1kcdr2t3yee9s/VEM.xlsx?dl=0)<br/>
This spreadsheet allows to analyze the nine cells of the VEM in a synthetic and synoptic way.

[`Venture Evaluation Matrix: Due diligence`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dm2we77t2uujzfo/VEM_Due_Diligence.xlsx?dl=0)<br/>
This spreadsheet allows to guide work on due diligence on an entrepreneurial venture by selecting appropriate actions for each of the nine cells of the VEM.

[`Venture Evaluation Matrix: Drawing conclusions`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7fid6amu883s343/VEM_Drawing-Conclusions.xlsx?dl=0)<br/>
This spreadsheet allows to bring the analysis of the nine cells of the VEM to conclusion, by deriving the attractiveness and competitive advantages of a venture.

[`The Venture Evaluation Matrix Spreadsheet Tool`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pdtntrytcra7852/VEM-Spreadsheet-Tool.xlsx?dl=0)<br/>
This tool allows to visualize the results of a VEM analysis in a practical way. It is based on the VEM spreadsheet but also requires users to assign a numerical score to each VEM cell, and to choose their own weight for each cell. This yields a summary ‘grade’ that can be used to compare or rank ventures. The VEM scores can also be represented graphically in a radar chart that allows to intuitively grasp the assessment of the venture. The Tool is set up so that users can easily add more questions or modify the existing questions for each cell of the VEM. Users can thus customize the spreadsheet tool to their own specific needs. The VEM Spreadsheet Tool is accompanied by an [`instruction sheet`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z5ligi0ozhj0zxl/VEM-Spreadsheet-Tool-Instructions.pdf?dl=0).
