## Submission guidelines

If you want to submit a team case memo or a team project pitch, please follow these guidelines about filenames, format and folders:
* **team case memo**: filename `teamname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `memetrify_lytro.pdf`. The team name can be anything as long as it remains unique and invariant throughout the course (exceptions allowed in case of team reformations). The file itself must contain *all* your groups full names and immatriculation numbers. Please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in your group folder, subfolder 'Cases'` to be found here: [studip group folders](https://e-learning.tuhh.de/studip/dispatch.php/course/files?cid=5ce9e6cf75b107d7acc2881e9b47ff6b). 
* **team project pitch**: `teamname_v[number].pdf`; e.g. `memetrify_v1.pdf`. The file itself must contain *all* your full names and immatriculation numbers. The version numbers should be consecutive integers. Please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in your group folder, subfolder 'Pitches'` to be found here: [studip group folders](https://e-learning.tuhh.de/studip/dispatch.php/course/files?cid=5ce9e6cf75b107d7acc2881e9b47ff6b).
