## Submission guidelines

If you want to submit a case memo or a team project pitch, please follow these guidelines about filenames, format and folders:
* **individal case memo**: filename `lastname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `ihl_lytro.pdf`. The file itself must contain your full name and immatriculation number. Please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in the folder named after the case company` to be found here: [studip case memo folder](https://e-learning.tuhh.de/studip/dispatch.php/course/files/index/3b46c540fa5d0194e51386f403f43037?cid=91d193c4645cd41e9a2c9b3f9e92445a). 
* **team project pitch**: `teamname_v[number].pdf`; e.g. `memetrify_v1.pdf`. The team name can be anything as long as it remains unique and invariant throughout the course (exceptions allowed in case of team reformations). The file itself must contain *all* your full names and immatriculation numbers. The version numbers should be consecutive integers. Please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in the folder named after your team` to be found here: [studip team presentation folder](https://e-learning.tuhh.de/studip/dispatch.php/course/files/index/70f9300101bed80085a96d8d39a08675?cid=91d193c4645cd41e9a2c9b3f9e92445a).
