## Note

If you want to submit a case memo or solution, please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in the folder named after the session that the case belongs to`. Please use the following file name and info:
* **individal case memo**: `lastname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `ihl_zenatix.pdf`. The file itself must contain your full name and immatriculation number.
* **team case memo**: `teamname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `memetrify_zenatix.pdf`. The team name can be anything as long as it remains unique and invariant throughout the course (exceptions allowed in case of team reformations). The file itself must contain *all* your full names and immatriculation numbers.

## Customer Segmentation

**Case**: [Lytro](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d4dp7y8w6ir76rl/Lytro_Case.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:

Jason Rosenthal decides to bring in your team to provide a rapid turn-around analysis of the challenges that Lytro is facing in terms of customer adoption, with a focus on medium-term recommendations and some speculation about the longer term. Specifically, he would like to meet with the Board on late Friday afternoon, and would like to receive a report that covers the following questions:

1) Why has there been such disconnect between the initial reception of Lytro in the “tech” community and the broader population? Was Lytro’s initial management effective at driving market acceptance? Why or why not?
2) Looking forward, identify two distinct potential Lytro customer segments. Describe how these customers are different than each other, and how the value proposition for each group must differ. Which customer should Lytro choose? Can they serve both equally well?
3) If you had an opportunity to set one important priority for how Lytro is positioned for the long term, what single recommendation would you make to the Board?

## Technology and Product Development

**Case**: [Evisort](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1u56cj50wtsz1xi/Evisort.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What is text analytics? Where is it used? Why has it grown it popularity? 
2) What is Evisort and how did it come about?
3) What are some ways analytics can be used in the legal field?
4) Why did Evisort decide to design its software for transactional use?
5) What are the stages of an Evisort project when it starts working with a new company?
6) How does Evisort ensure that the answers its software provides are accurate? How does the software mitigate errors the AI might make?
7) What is Evisort's competitive advantage in the marketplace?
8) What is the main descision point the co-founders face at the end of the case? What factors need to be considered before the co-founders can plan their growth strategy?

## Competition and Market Analysis

**Case**: [Avatech](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pmdi9dx6n7pb3c0/Avatech_Case.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
The Avatech founding team has developed four potential "models" for bringing Avatech to market:
* `The Intellectual Property Model`: Under this approach, Avatech would focus on building a reputation and intellectual property portfolio for being the leading innovator in snow safety. The goal would be to hire expert researchers and engineers in this field and aim at building a solid patent portfolio, which they would license out to other sporting equipment manufacturers.
* `The Collaboration Model`: Under this approach, Avatech would focus on building tight partnership with other established sporting equipment manufacturers. This strategy will allow Avatech to take advantage of the existing supplier and distribution channels and become a complement to the incumbent companies’ existing product portfolio. This would require Avatech to hire additional experienced business development people to build partnerships.
* `The Leading Innovator Model`: Under this approach, Avatech would focus on positioning itself as a differentiated sporting equipment brand with strong technological expertise. They would particularly aim at penetrating the early adopter group. In order to strike out on their own, Avatech would need to build its own value chain of suppliers and distributors.
* `The Platform Model`: In this model, Avatech would transform itself into a digital ski safety platform that integrate multiple sources of safety data, from Avatech users to forecasting services. This would require Avatech to hire software developers and data scientists to build the platform and analytics.

1) What are the strengths and weaknesses of these four alternatives?
2) Considering that the snow detecting equipment industry is still in its infancy, which of these approaches (or a variant of your own design) would help a startup such as Avatech establish a customer value proposition and also position Avatech to be able to succeed on an ongoing basis?
3) Provide a detailed action plan and the rationale for justifying your choice.
4) How would you size the relevant market for Avatech (i.e. ski (safety) equipment)?

## (Platform) Business Models

**Case**: [CampusHash](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ln2pz1fwe5d98iy/CampusHash.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What is CampusHash‘s current business model? (Only in class: Outline them with the business model canvas.) 
2) How does it fit into the Entrepreneurial Strategy Compass?
3) How does the business model change with the three considered alternatives? (Only in class: Outline them with the business model canvas.) 
4) How do the three considered alternatives fit into the Entrepreneurial Strategy Compass? What type of pivot does each of these business model changes refer to?
5) Develop one more additonal alternative with the Business Model Navigator Patterns! (Only in class.)
6) Can you evaluate and compare the currenet and alternative business models in monetary terms: i.e. annual costs, revenue, profits? (Optional: after class.)

## Revenue Models and Pricing

**Case 1**: [PassionConnect](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zwv99gq6wyp7als/PassionConnect.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What criteria should the co-founders use to evaluate each of the revenue models they consider? [^1]
[^1]: Here is a list of possible criteria:
	- **Financial:** predictability of revenues (recurring vs. one-time); positive cash flow cycle (earn before you spend); profit potential; fixed vs. variable cost; customer acquisition / marketing cost
	- **Users / customers:** impact on user experience; impact on user growth (speed up or slow down); scalability with new users; conversion rate (to paying users)
	- **Feasibility:** alignment with founder goals and value proposition; required investment to launch, integration / fit with current business activities
2) Evaluate each revenue model against your selection of criteria – which one should they choose?
3) What are the key decisions to be made for the chosen revenue model in order to implement it?


**Case 2**: [Basecamp](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0r5s5q74s3fi3a0/Basecamp.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) Evaluate the price-testing process at Basecamp. Should Lorang have conducted different tests or in a different manner? What is the purpose of price testing at this stage of a venture?
2) Evaluate the results of the tests that Basecamp did conduct. What is your interpretation of the data from the A/B test, the price sensitivity survey, the team's dicussion of "customers and comparables" (p. 11), and Fred's comments about pricing (Exhibit 3)?
3) Evaluate each pricing option being considered for BC3. If you were Noah Lorang, which change (if any) would you recommend for BC3 and why?

## Lean Startup & Experimentation

`Please choose in advance one of the following three cases to work on in your group. Then it would only be smart to choose this case also for an optional individual case memo :wink:`

**Case 1**: [Rent The Runway](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sgtqule2e5d65c8/RentTheRunway.pdf?dl=0)

**Case 2**: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sex7u286xce8kw4/Dropbox.pdf?dl=0)

**Case 3**: [Lit Motors](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6o4an8s39x7dc9l/LitMotors.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions for all three cases`:
1) What hypotheses did the company seek to validate so far?
2) What did the company do to validate these hypotheses?
3) How do you evaluate these validation efforts? What was good, what could be improved and how?
4) What hypotheses should the company validate next? And how?
