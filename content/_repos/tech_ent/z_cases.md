* **individal case memo**: `lastname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `ihl_zenatix.pdf`. The file itself must contain your full name and immatriculation number.
* **team case memo**: `teamname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `memetrify_zenatix.pdf`. The team name can be anything as long as it remains unique and invariant throughout the course (exceptions allowed in case of team reformations). The file itself must contain *all* your full names and immatriculation numbers.

## Revenue Models and Pricing

**Case 1**: [PassionConnect](https://www.dropbox.com/s/39fbzukq6hvj4vj/PassionConnect.pdf?dl=0) (use this case for individual memos, or just read it to prepare in-class group work)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What criteria should the co-founders use to evaluate each of the revenue models they consider? [^1]
[^1]: Here is a list of possible criteria:
	- **Financial:** predictability of revenues (recurring vs. one-time); positive cash flow cycle (earn before you spend); profit potential; fixed vs. variable cost; customer acquisition / marketing cost
	- **Users / customers:** impact on user experience; impact on user growth (speed up or slow down); scalability with new users; conversion rate (to paying users)
	- **Feasibility:** alignment with founder goals and value proposition; required investment to launch, integration / fit with current business activities
2) Can you come up with an additonal revenue model they do not yet consider?
3) Evaluate each revenue model against your selection of criteria – which one should they choose?
4) What are the key decisions to be made for the chosen revenue model in order to implement it?

## Lean Startup & Experimentation

`Please choose in advance one of the following three cases to work on in your group. Then it would only be smart to choose this case also for an optional individual case memo :wink:`

## Marketing

`The Wildfang case should not be used for a memo. Just read this short case in advance (esp. pp. 8-11).:`

**Case 1**: [Wildfang](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fsc6xshlqpc3r2p/Wildfang.pdf?dl=0), [supplemental Excel worksheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3eymlrjv08n6exw/Wildfang.xlsx?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) Compare the two business model designs under consideration with the current one, i.e. private label B&C and multisided plattform.
2) Using the supplemental Excel worksheet, estimate a blended CLV for a simulated portfolio of 10,000 shoppers. The assumptions used to populate the input worksheet are provided in the case narrative.
3) Combining the business model and CLV considerations: what are the riskiest assumptions associated with each growth option? Which one would you prefer?


`This case can be used for a memo (Question 5 is optional for the memo):`

**Case 2**: [Hubble Contact Lenses](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gc9qdblhlg3iui2/HubbleContactLenses.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What are strengths and weaknesses in Hubble's current business model?
2) How efficiently does Hubble acquire and retain customers? What do they do well? What needs improvement?
3) Assess how Hubble has used owned, earned, and paid media? What needs to change as the company scales? Why?
4) What is the role of offline and online advertising in acquiring Hubble customers? Evaluate the following decisions facing Hubble regarding online versus offline media allocation:
	- As of April 2018, Hubble is allocating 78% of its paid media spend to online advertising and 22% to traditional channels (i.e., TV, radio, podcast, and direct mail). Is this budget allocation between online and offline appropriate and if not, how would you adjust it?
	- Based on the results of the TV campaigns, would you recommend that Hubble switch some of its spending to TV? Why or why not? How much?
	- Should Hubble continue to spend the bulk of its budget on reaching new consumers or reallocate some of that spending to retarget those who have already been exposed to its ads? Why?
5) As Hubble prepares to scale its business following its upcoming fundraise, how should they allocate capital across the following decisions? Which, if any, would you priotitize in the short term?
	- Should Hubble expand its product line?
	- Should Hubble move beyond DTC? If so, should it open its own flagship stores, sell via a wholesale model through retailers, or create a reseller option for opticians?
	- Should Hubble expand internationally or focus on its business at home in the U.S.?
	- How do each of these scaling decisions impact Hubble's integrated marekting communication strategy?

## Marketing & Sales

`Case 1 is probably not perfectly suited for a memo, but you can try by adressing a subset of questions (that require qualitative judgement). The team work on quantitative funnel analysis of case 1 will consume the entire class on June 22. Case 2 and 3 can be prepared for the class on June 29.`


**Case 1**: [eSig](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4tf9n1ekextue4f/eSig.pdf?dl=0), [supplemental Excel worksheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2g7zxpfhit19ep/eSig.xlsx?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:

1) For each major marketing medium used by eSig -- direct traffic, email, organic search, and paid ads -- how have conversion rates from accounts created to paid upgrades been trending? What hypotheses do you have about factors behind conversion rate trends?
2) What might explain changes in the number of accounts created via direct traffic over time? In accounts created via organic search?
3) Does eSig benefit from virality? What is your estimate of the viral coefficient for an eSig Free account? What can the company do to increase virality?
4) Have eSig's investments in paid marketing been yielding a good return?
5) Contractors have produced a steady stream of 1-2 blog posts per week for eSig over the past year at a total cost of $5,000. Was this a good investment? What other factors, besides the data in the Excel Supplement, would you want to answer this question? Why?
6) What is your current estimate of the lifetime value of an eSig Pro customer? What’s the most we should be willing to spend to acquire a Pro customer?
7) In the case, Tsai asks Dalton to project the number of Pro customers as of 3/31/16 if eSig spends nothing on paid marketing between 12/1/15 and 3/31/16. How would you allocate $1 million in paid marketing budget across channels and months between 12/1/15 and 3/31/16? How would you go about formulating this projection? What additional research, analysis or experiments would you do to make such a projection? Why? 

<br/>

**Case 2**: [InsightSquared](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qc9mmqho1p6vt84/InsightSquared.pdf?dl=0), [supplemental Excel worksheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9qqbm07646n6fzt/InsightSquared.xlsx?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) Which plan would you choose? Shilmover's plan? Clemens' plan?  One of their plans with variations?  Why? If you prefer a variation, what would be your revenue target for 2014 and how much would you spend on marketing and sales?
2) From a structural perspective, how did Clemens and Shilmover build their plans differently? What are the pros and cons of each approach?
3) What can we learn from the 2013 data about the relative effectiveness of various sales and marketing techniques at InsightSquared? As you look ahead to the 2014 plan, are there additional or different considerations you would factor into the decisions facing Clemens and Shilmover?
4) How would you decide on the revenue target for 2014? Why not plan for a larger target? Why not plan for a smaller target?

<br/>

`Assignment Questions`:
1) Assess AnswerDash’s current go-to-market approach, including customer selection, pricing, communication, and sales efforts. Which aspects do you like? Which ones don’t you like? In class only: Based on the current pricing model what is the lifetime value of a customer to AnswerDash?  (Make reasonable assumptions as needed.)
2) In class only: Calculate the economic value that the AnswerDash product delivers for an e-commerce vs. Software-as-a-Service customer. Separate between cost savings and revenue lift benefits. (As as a starting point, you can consider an organization with 100,000 monthly web visitors and $1,000,000 monthly revenues.) 
3) What is your view on the three primary options AnswerDash is contemplating going forward? Which would you recommend by the company pursue?
