## Note

If you want to submit a case memo or solution, please `upload the pdf file to Stud.IP in the folder named after the session that the case belongs to`. Please use the following file name and info:
* **individal case memo**: `lastname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `ihl_zenatix.pdf`. The file itself must contain your full name and immatriculation number.
* **team case memo**: `teamname_casename.pdf`; e.g. `memetrify_zenatix.pdf`. The team name can be anything as long as it remains unique and invariant throughout the course (exceptions allowed in case of team reformations). The file itself must contain *all* your full names and immatriculation numbers.

## Customer Segmentation

**Case**: [Lytro](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d4dp7y8w6ir76rl/Lytro_Case.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:

Jason Rosenthal decides to bring in your team to provide a rapid turn-around analysis of the challenges that Lytro is facing in terms of customer adoption, with a focus on medium-term recommendations and some speculation about the longer term. Specifically, he would like to meet with the Board on late Friday afternoon, and would like to receive a report that covers the following questions:

1) Why has there been such disconnect between the initial reception of Lytro in the “tech” community and the broader population? Was Lytro’s initial management effective at driving market acceptance? Why or why not?
2) Looking forward, identify two distinct potential Lytro customer segments. Describe how these customers are different than each other, and how the value proposition for each group must differ. Which customer should Lytro choose? Can they serve both equally well?
3) If you had an opportunity to set one important priority for how Lytro is positioned for the long term, what single recommendation would you make to the Board?
