## Learning Objectives

This section on revenue models & pricing provides resources and materials for you to self-study in order to support the following learning objectives:
1. Choose an appropriate revenue model as one important aspect of a startup business model.
2. Understand the benchmarks for price setting: customer value, competition, cost.
3. Design a pricing model along several dimensions.
4. Consider pricing principles implied by behavioral economics and psychology.
5. Learn about tools to test pricing and measure willingness-to-pay.

## Procedure and Your Tasks

The following procedure has the objective to satisfy your articulated needs in terms of both clarity, structure, and predictability as well as flexibility, convenience and personalization (if these are compatible at all):
1. Go through the materials provided below, by yourself or in your team. 
	- Immediate questions will be answered in the Q&A session on Sunday, June 14, between 9-13, on [Zoom](https://tuhh.zoom.us/j/8013501889). I will leave this video conference open at all time. Participation is voluntary. You can log on and off whenever your questions arise. 
	- Questions (of common interest) that pop up later and while working on your tasks should be asked in the commenting function either on this page or on insideNIT so that they are visible for everybody.
2. Based on this material, your tasks with respect to your own my-project are the following:
	- explain the choice of your revenue model(s) (e.g. by motivating why they are inferior to alternatives or how to measure their success via KPIs).
	- explain your pricing strategy by explicating strategic & economic considerations (e.g. using the Sequoia worksheet or the comprehensive pricing framework).
	- design a (set of) tests that allow you to determine an appropriate pricing scheme for the launch of your product or service, including:
		- a detailed description and visualization of stimuli shown to customers (e.g. landing pages, feature lists, survey questions, exact price tags / points to be tested),
		- the experimental design (i.e. who sees what stimulus, e.g. A/B, multivariate A/B/n, full vs. fractional factorial designs, repeated / within-subject / conjoint designs),
		- an estimation of the required sample size,
		- a cost and time estimate to actually run these tests.[^1]
[^1]: You are NOT supposed to actually run these tests! If these tasks partly overlap with prior deliverables, then consider this as synergy to make progress on the same aspects, not redundancy. Your focus here should be on pricing, though.
3. In addition, and probably before you apply the material to your own projects, choose either the B2C or B2B case provided below (depending on the focus of your my-project) and prepare solutions/ answers for the assignment questions.
4. Upon initial completion of these tasks, each team should schedule a 1.5 hour Zoom meeting with me [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ZeDIz8DYia4TUm3yQU1ZNTLWycmFEgGcDDxBEaTSSc/edit#gid=387312941) to pitch and receive feedback on their results as well as the chance to revise them before final submission. These Zoom meetings will be open to all teams to participate and learn (on a voluntary basis). The above deliverables will account for 25% of the grade in this term (next to the deliverables for the Hackathon, Prof. Lüthje and Prof. Fixon).

## Cases


**Case 1 (B-to-C)**: [MoviePass](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wmduhuj1x9bfx5z/MoviePass.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) What is MoviePass‘ business model? Describe the value proposition (what?), revenue model (why?), and value creation (how?) for both sides of their platform model.
2) Are movie goers beeing subsidized? Calculate the average gross margin per user (AGMPU)!
3) What are the critical assumptions you would want to test with regard to the revenue and pricing model? 
4) Describe in detail how to test these critical assumptions.


<br/>

**Case 2 (B-to-B)**: [AnswerDash](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jyu705ou96sgzkp/AnswerDash.pdf?dl=0)

`Assignment Questions`:
1) Assess AnswerDash’s current revenue and pricing model. Which aspects do you like? Which ones don’t you like?
2) Calculate the economic value that the AnswerDash product delivers for an e-commerce vs. Software-as-a-Service customer. Separate between cost savings and revenue lift benefits. (As as a starting point, you can consider an organization with 100,000 monthly web visitors and $1,000,000 monthly revenues.) 
3) For the three strategic option AnswerDash considers, what are (your hypothesized) implications for the design of an appropriate pricing model? How would you change the current pricing approach under each of these three options?
4) Describe in detail how to test whether the changes to the pricing approach suggested above work or not?
