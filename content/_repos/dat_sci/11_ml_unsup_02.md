Explaining Black-Box Models With LIME

* Using lime For Local Model Explanations
* Making An Explainer
* Explaining Multiple Cases

LIME: This is the tool we use to explain deep learning, stacked ensembles, and other "unexplainable" models.

We use lime to explain the black-box classification model showing which features drive whether the employee stays or leaves.
