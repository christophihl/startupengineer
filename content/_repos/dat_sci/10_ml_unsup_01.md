Explaining Black-Box Models With LIME

* Using lime For Local Model Explanations
* Making An Explainer
* Explaining Multiple Cases

We use lime to explain the black-box classification model showing which features drive whether the employee stays or leaves.

Tools:

H2O Automated Machine Learning: This is the primary modeling package and function that we implement in this course.
LIME: This is the tool we use to explain deep learning, stacked ensembles, and other "unexplainable" models.
